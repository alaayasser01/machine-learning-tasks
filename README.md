# Machine Learning Tasks Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Tasks Repository**! This collection showcases my exploration of various machine learning tasks, spanning from fundamental techniques to advanced applications. Each task involves in-depth analysis, experimentation, and examination of the effects of different parameters.

## Tasks Covered

1. **Linear Regression:** Predictive modeling technique for analyzing relationships between variables.
2. **Linear Classification:** Categorizing data using linear decision boundaries.
3. **Logistic Regression:** Statistical method for binary outcome prediction.
4. **Bayes Theory:** Bayesian methods for probabilistic modeling and inference.
5. **Decision Trees:** Hierarchical structures for classification and regression.
6. **Random Forest:** Ensemble learning with multiple decision trees.
7. **SVM Classification:** Support Vector Machines for binary and multiclass classification.
8. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques for handling high-dimensional data.
9. **Clustering:** Unsupervised learning for grouping similar data points.
10. **Word to Vector Representation:** Transforming words into numerical vectors.
11. **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learning optimal actions in an environment.
12. **Recommender Systems:** Predicting and recommending items based on user preferences.
